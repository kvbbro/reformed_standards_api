CHAPTER 1. Of the Holy Scripture
-----------------  PASSAGE  -----------------
1. Although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence, do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable;*a* yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God, and of his will, which is necessary unto salvation;*b* therefore it pleased the Lord, at sundry times, and in divers manners, to reveal himself, and to declare that his will unto his Church;*c*and afterwards, for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the Church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing;*d* which maketh the holy Scripture to be most necessary;*e* those former ways of God’s revealing his will unto his people being now ceased.*f*

3. The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the Canon of the Scripture; and therefore are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings.*a*

a. Luke 24:27, 44; Rom 3:2; 2 Pet 1:21.
-----------------  PASSAGE  -----------------
4. The authority of the holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and obeyed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the Author thereof; and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.*a*
-----------------  PROOFTEXTS  -----------------
a. 1 Thes 2:13; 2 Tim 3:16; 2 Pet 1:19, 21; 1 John 5:9.
-----------------  PASSAGE  -----------------
5. We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church to an high and reverent esteem of the holy Scripture;*a* and the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of man’s salvation, the many other incomparable excellencies, and the entire perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God; yet, notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.*b*
-----------------  PROOFTEXTS  -----------------
a. 1 Tim 3:15.
b. Isa 59:21; John 16:13-14; 1 Cor 2:10-12; 1 John 2:20, 27.

6. The whole counsel of God, concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man’s salvation, faith, and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men.*a* Nevertheless we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word;*b* and that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the Church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence, according to the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed.*c*

-----------------  PASSAGE  -----------------
7. All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all;*a* yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and observed, for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them.*b*

8. The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical;*a* so as in all controversies of religion the Church is finally to appeal unto them.*b* But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God who have right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the fear of God, to read and search them,*c* therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come,*d* that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner,*e* and, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope.*f*

10.

By it a sinner, out of the sight and sense, not only of the danger, but also of the filthiness and odiousness of his sins, as contrary to the holy nature and righteous law of God, and upon the apprehension of his mercy in Christ to such as are penitent, so grieves for and hates his sins as to turn from them all unto God,*a* purposing and endeavoring to walk with him in all the ways of his commandments.*b*

CHAPTER 16. Of Good Works

-----------------  PASSAGE  -----------------
3. Their ability to do good works is not at all of themselves, but wholly from the Spirit of Christ.*a* And that they may be enabled thereunto, besides the graces they have already received, there is required an actual influence of the same Holy Spirit to work in them to will and to do of his good pleasure;*b* yet are they not hereupon to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to perform any duty unless upon a special motion of the Spirit; but they ought to be diligent in stirring up the grace of God that is in them.*c*

-----------------  PASSAGE  -----------------
5. We cannot, by our best works, merit pardon of sin, or eternal life at the hand of God, by reason of the great disproportion that is between them and the glory to come, and the infinite distance that is between us and God, whom by them we can neither profit nor satisfy for the debt of our former sins;*a* but when we have done all we can, we have done but our duty, and are unprofitable servants;*b* and because, as they are good, they proceed from his Spirit;*c* and as they are wrought by us, they are defiled and mixed with so much weakness and imperfection that they cannot endure the severity of God’s judgment.*d*

CHAPTER 18. Of the Assurance of Grace and Salvation
-----------------  PASSAGE  -----------------
1. Although hypocrites and other unregenerate men may vainly deceive themselves with false hopes and carnal presumptions of being in the favour of God and estate of salvation,*a* which hope of theirs shall perish:*b* yet such as truly believe in the Lord Jesus, and love him in sincerity, endeavoring to walk in all good conscience before him, may in this life be certainly assured that they are in a state of grace,*c* and may rejoice in the hope of the glory of God, which hope shall never make them ashamed.*d*

2. This certainty is not a bare conjectural and probable persuasion, grounded upon a fallible hope;*a* but an infallible assurance of faith, founded upon the divine truth of the promises of salvation,*b* the inward evidence of those graces unto which these promises are made,*c* the testimony of the Spirit of adoption witnessing with our spirits that we are the children of God:*d* which Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance, whereby we are sealed to the day of redemption.*e*

-----------------  PASSAGE  -----------------
3. This infallible assurance doth not so belong to the essence of faith, but that a true believer may wait long, and conflict with many difficulties before he be partaker of it:*a* yet, being enabled by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he may, without extraordinary revelation, in the right use of ordinary means, attain thereunto.*b* And therefore it is the duty of everyone to give all diligence to make his calling and election sure;*c* that thereby his heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, in love and thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulness in the duties of obedience,*d* the proper fruits of this assurance: so far is it from inclining men to looseness.*e*

-----------------  PASSAGE  -----------------
4. True believers may have the assurance of their salvation divers ways shaken, diminished, and intermitted; as, by negligence in preserving of it; by falling into some special sin, which woundeth the conscience, and grieveth the Spirit; by some sudden or vehement temptation; by God’s withdrawing the light of his countenance, and suffering even such as fear him to walk in darkness and to have no light:*a* yet are they never utterly destitute of that seed of God, and life of faith, that love of Christ and the brethren, that sincerity of heart and conscience of duty, out of which, by the operation of the Spirit, this assurance may in due time be revived,*b* and by the which, in the meantime, they are supported from utter despair.*c*

-----------------  PASSAGE  -----------------
6. Although true believers be not under the law as a covenant of works, to be thereby justified or condemned;*a* yet is it of great use to them, as well as to others; in that, as a rule of life, informing them of the will of God and their duty, it directs and binds them to walk accordingly;*b* discovering also the sinful pollutions of their nature, hearts, and lives;*c* so as, examining themselves thereby, they may come to further conviction of, humiliation for, and hatred against sin;*d* together with a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ, and the perfection of his obedience.*e* It is likewise of use to the regenerate, to restrain their corruptions, in that it forbids sin;*f* and the threatenings of it serve to show what even their sins deserve, and what afflictions in this life they may expect for them, although freed from the curse thereof threatened in the law.*g* The promises of it, in like manner, show them God’s approbation of obedience, and what blessings they may expect upon the performance thereof;*h* although not as due to them by the law as a covenant of works:*i* so as a man’s doing good, and refraining from evil, because the law encourageth to the one, and deterreth from the other, is no evidence of his being under the law, and not under grace.*j*

1. The liberty which Christ hath purchased for believers under the gospel consists in their freedom from the guilt of sin, the condemning wrath of God, the curse of the moral law;*a* and in their being delivered from this present evil world, bondage to Satan, and dominion of sin,*b* from the evil of afflictions, the sting of death, the victory of the grave, and everlasting damnation;*c* as also in their free access to God,*d* and their yielding obedience unto him, not out of slavish fear, but a child-like love and willing mind.*e* All which were common also to believers under the law;*f* but under the New Testament the liberty of Christians is further enlarged in their freedom from the yoke of the ceremonial law, to which the Jewish Church was subjected;*g* and in greater boldness of access to the throne of grace,*h* and in fuller communications of the free Spirit of God, than believers under the law did ordinarily partake of.*i*

2. God alone is Lord of the conscience,*a* and hath left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men which are in anything contrary to his Word, or beside it, in matters of faith or worship.*b* So that to believe such doctrines, or to obey such commands out of conscience, is to betray true liberty of conscience;*c* and the requiring of an implicit faith, and an absolute and blind obedience, is to destroy liberty of conscience, and reason also.*d*

The efficacy of baptism is not tied to that moment of time wherein it is administered;*a* yet, notwithstanding, by the right use of this ordinance the grace promised is not only offered, but really exhibited and conferred by the Holy Ghost, to such (whether of age or infants) as that grace belongeth unto, according to the counsel of God’s own will, in his appointed time.*b*
